# Wolf Language Specification — 04: ABI

Status: normative, v0 (sprint s05). Anchors `[abi.*]`. Implemented by
s29 (abi-v0), s41 (release tier), s55–s56 (Tier-F); differentially
fuzzed against platform C compilers by s49. Evidence: reports/06 §5;
per-target documents saved in `.docs/refs/articles/` (SysV AMD64 psABI,
AAPCS64, win64, Apple arm64 deltas).

## §1 wolf-abi-0 `[abi.native]`

- `[abi.native.unstable]` The native ABI is **versioned and unstable**:
  `wolf-abi-0`. Nothing about it is a compatibility promise; separately
  compiled wolf artifacts must agree on the version string or fail to
  link. Stability is a post-1.0 question.
- `[abi.native.layout]` Layout freedom is the point (T1): outside
  `#[repr(c)]`, field order is unspecified, niches are packed, and
  **no address identity** exists for value fields (s04 §7/O10). Programs
  observing layout via Tier-3 pointer arithmetic get target- and
  version-specific answers.
- `[abi.native.niche]` Guaranteed niches (normative, so safe wrappers
  are zero-cost — report 06 §5): an option-shaped enum over `handle T`,
  a non-null raw pointer wrapper, or `shared T` occupies exactly the
  payload's size — the null/absent case is the niche. This list may
  grow; it may not shrink.
- `[abi.native.call]` Calls may use multiple return registers, pass
  small aggregates in registers, and omit shadow space and frame
  pointers where the target permits. Callee/caller-save split is
  "allocator-tuned within a target's published contract" — each target
  backend publishes its contract file; Tier-F is the reference
  implementation.
- `[abi.native.nounwind]` There are **no unwind tables and no landing
  pads** anywhere in wolf code (D30/Perceus precondition, s04
  `[mem.shared.drop]`): every control transfer is a call, return,
  branch, or trap.

## §2 C membranes `[abi.c]`

- `[abi.c.seams]` Exactly three ABI seams exist: `extern "c"` function
  types/imports, `export`ed wolf functions (C-callable), and
  `#[repr(c)]` (+ `packed`, `transparent`) data. There is no fourth
  mechanism; everything else is `wolf-abi-0` internal.
- `[abi.c.types]` Only repr(c)-compatible types cross a membrane by
  value: scalars, raw pointers, `#[repr(c)]` aggregates. Anything else
  is a compile error with a fix-it naming the nearest compatible shape
  (E1201).
- `[abi.c.targets]` Per-target lowering contracts, by name: SysV AMD64
  classification (linux/freebsd x86-64), AAPCS64 (linux aarch64),
  Apple-arm64 deltas (macOS), win64 (windows x86-64). The s49
  differential fuzzer against the platform C compiler is each
  contract's acceptance test.
- `[abi.c.panic]` A wolf fault reaching an `extern "c"` or `export`
  boundary **aborts the process** (after the fault report). There is no
  `c-unwind` at v1; C frames are never unwound (`[conc.cancel.c]`).

## §3 Callback and pointer rules `[abi.callback]`

- `[abi.callback.reentry]` A wolf function passed to C as a callback
  re-enters the safe-point domain on entry (`[conc.ffi.external]`); its
  ABI is the membrane ABI regardless of how C stored the pointer.
- `[abi.callback.stash]` C-held pointers obey s04 `[mem.boundary.ffi]`:
  past a call's return, C may retain only `handle`-backed or pinned
  `#[trusted]`-region pointers. The membrane type checker rejects
  signatures that would smuggle other wolf pointers into retention-shaped
  parameters only where declared (`#[retains]` annotation on the import
  — c10 mechanism; clause here so the ABI table is closed).

## §4 Error-value ABI `[abi.err]`

- `[abi.err.repr]` A `!T` return lowers to a two-value contract:
  a **discriminant** (ok/error) and a **payload** (T or the error row's
  representation), in registers where the target's contract allows,
  else via sret-style memory. Observable contract only: callers branch
  on the discriminant; there is no unwinding, no landing pads, no
  side-channel (errno-shaped) state — ever.
- `[abi.err.row]` Error rows lower to a tag + payload union whose layout
  is `wolf-abi-0` internal (rows never cross C membranes; an `export`ed
  function returning `!T` is E1201 with a fix-it to flatten).
- `[abi.err.trace]` Debug builds accrete error return traces at each `?`
  propagation and `else` observation point, into trace storage disjoint
  from the value path. Normative: debug and release differ **only in
  this metadata**, never in control flow or in the §4 value contract.
- `[abi.err.trap]` Traps (s06 vocabulary) are not errors: they do not
  use this ABI; they terminate through the fault path
  (`[abi.c.panic]` at boundaries).

Cross-references: no-unwinding invariant `[abi.native.nounwind]` ⇄
`[conc.cancel.defer]` (cancellation uses returns) ⇄ `[conc.proc.kill]`
(kill uses region frees, not defers) — the three clauses jointly close
D30's "errors are values" story at the binary level.
