# s288: build and run at a COMMIT, never the live tree (the lane rule "Build
# from a commit"). Adapted from s285's build-at-interp.sh, with one change
# s287's rig made after a shared worktree moved under a queued take: every
# commit gets its OWN worktree, $LANE/build-<repo>-<sha7>, created here before
# the lock is waited on and never moved. A warm target is cloned in (clonefile)
# from WARM when given; the fresh checkout's sources are newer, so cargo
# rebuilds the workspace crates and keeps the registry's.
# usage: [WARM=<dir>/target] at-commit.sh <repo> <rev> <cmd> [args...]
