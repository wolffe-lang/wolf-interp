# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-10

The binary is named `lupin`; the package and repository stay `wolf-interp`.

- `lupin FILE.lu` runs a file; `lupin -` reads a program from stdin; bare
  `lupin` opens the REPL. The exit code reports the program: its own
  `exit(N)`, 2 on a static-phase rejection, 3 on a trap or UB finding, 4 on
  `unsupported`.
- `run` is the explicit subcommand spelling and carries `--seed`,
  `--schedule` and `--json` (the spec/06 observation record at the front
  door). A subcommand name wins over a file of the same name.
- `lupin eval 'CODE'` (short spelling `-e`) evaluates a snippet in a fresh
  session and prints what the REPL would print.
- `lupin check FILE...` runs the frontend only (lex, parse, resolve).
- Observation records and bundle manifests report `"impl": "lupin"` with
  `impl_version` 0.1.0; `--version` prints the version, the package, and
  the upstream pin.
